Ella Bella App

Description:
This app is in beta and is more of a prototype for Ella Bella Vintage Finds (REAL STORE!) 
You can sell things to them for consignment or just outright. I've included a way to send a form to ella bella (me for now) and it will include info the possible sale.

Instructions: 
You can change pages by clicking the button on the top right and select a different page
On the Contact Us page, you can push the google maps button to get directions to the store
On the Contact Us page, you can push the facebook page and bring them to their facebook page for the business.
